# myAirline-frontend
React.js front end for myAirline (https://github.com/flobbe10/myAirline). <br>
Depends on the backend (https://github.com/flobbe10/myAirline-flightservice) and wont run properly without it.

## Run
1. ```docker-compose up``` with 'docker-compose.yml' from https://github.com/flobbe10/myAirline.
2. Got to http://localhost:3000.

## Docker image
